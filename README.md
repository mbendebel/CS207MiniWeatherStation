# Repository Title [v1]

This repository will display how to make an 8-button game controller on the Arduino for Assignment #4 in CS207: Building Interactive Gadgets (Winter 2020).

The game controller's input, built based on the Arduino, will controlled by pushbutton switches. Once the buttons are pressed, it will send commands to the computer via serial.


Repository Contents
============
* **/build** - Files that are compiled and ready to run / upload.
* **/img** - This is where the image files for this readme are.
* **/README.md** - File explaining what thsi project is.


Requirements and Materials
============
Bill of Materials:
* 8 x push buttons
* 8 x 10k ohm resistor
* 1 x breadboard
* 1 x Arduino Uno R3


Build Instructions
==================

This is a generic breadboard diagram of the game controller with the buttons non-traditionally placed inline with one another unlike a real game controller.
