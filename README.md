# Arduino-Based Mini Weather Station [v1]

This repository is intended for the CS207 - Winter 2020 Final Project.
This repository will display how to make your own Arduino-Based Mini Weather Station. The mini weather station will read data from two main sensors (a raindrops sensor and a BME280 sensor) and output the data neatly to an LCD screen.

Enjoy!


Repository Contents
============
* **/build** - Files that are compiled and ready to run / upload.
* **/img** - This is where the image files for this readme are.
* **/README.md** - File explaining what thsi project is.


Requirements and Materials
============
Bill of Materials:
* 1 x Arduino Uno R3
* 1 x breadboard
* 1 x BME-280 Pressure Sensor (Reads air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and altitude)
* 1 x 1.8" ST7735 LCD Display
* 1 x Enclosure
* 1 x Rain Sensor Kit


Build Instructions
==================

This is a generic breadboard diagram of the game controller with the buttons non-traditionally placed inline with one another unlike a real game controller.
